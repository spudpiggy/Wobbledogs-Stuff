# Wobbledogs-Stuff

## Huh?
**This isn't a full commitment, it's literally just scripts for funny dog game. I have school ya know**

The AHK scripts are designed to macro a few tasks that I as a breeder saw were taking way too long to do.

Most notably, importing/exporting dogs to a file and aging dogs up to adult for quick multi-generation breeding.

## Python toolbox
You'll need to have pyperclip installed, as I'm using it to interact with the clipboard in the toolbox scripts.

`python -m pip install pyperclip`

Once you've done that, just export a code to your clipboard and run whatever script.

Age will age the code up to an adult. This allows them to be bred like any other dog.

Unwind will convert the code into an easier-to-edit format. The spreadsheet uses unwound codes.

Wind will convert an unwound code back into something the game will recognise.

spaceDOTexe for the original un/winder scripts that the python toolbox is based on

eLe for the dog code research, as well as the spreadsheet to easily edit them
